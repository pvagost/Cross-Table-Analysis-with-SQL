# Cross-Table-Analysis-with-SQL
These codes are used to answer to these questions from README file by using SQL and python libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, etc.

Q1. Analyze home field advantage across different leagues and seasons: Does playing at home provide
a statistically significant advantage, and has this advantage changed over time (2010-2015)?
Q2. Identify which physical attributes (height, weight, BMI) best predict player performance in
different positions, and quantify whether these relationships vary by league.
Q3. Analyze the defensive vs. offensive balance: For each league, examine the relationship between
goals scored and goals conceded, identifying teams that succeeded with defensive-focused
strategies versus offensive-focused approaches.
